# Gester (Hand Gesture-Controlled Presenter)

## Introduction
Welcome to Gester, a project aimed at revolutionizing presentation control by harnessing the power of hand gestures. Traditional presentation controls often rely on physical devices like keyboards and mice, limiting user mobility and interaction. Gester seeks to overcome these limitations by providing an AI-based solution that allows users to control presentations using intuitive hand gestures, thereby enhancing user engagement and eliminating the need for external hardware.

## Project Objectives
Gester aims to achieve the following objectives:
- Enable users to navigate through slides using simple hand gestures, such as moving to the next or previous slide.
- Provide functionality for annotating or drawing on slides through hand movements, enhancing the presentation experience.
